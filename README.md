# Autoencoders-in-Spike-Sorting
Autoencoders, a type of neural network that allow for unsupervised learning, can be used in the feature extraction of spike sorting.



## Setup
The 'requirements.txt' file indicates the dependencies required for running the code. 

The synthetic data used in this study can be downloaded from: 
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgNd2yQs3Ad0gSjeHumstkCYNcAk?e=QfGIJO
or
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardeleanrichard/simulationsdataset.

The real data used in this study can be downloaded from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardeleanrichard/realdata
or in the 'real_data' folder of the repository.


In the constants.py file the path to the DATA folder can be set. We recommend the following structure for the data:

DATA/
* TINS/
  * M045_009/ : insert the real data files
* SIMULATIONS/ : insert the synthetic data files
